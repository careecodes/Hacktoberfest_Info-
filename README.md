## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software in partnership with Github.

<li>Pull requests can be made in any <strong>GitHub-hosted</strong> repositories/projects.</li>
<li>You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. Pull requests reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt.</p>
